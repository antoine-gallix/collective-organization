This is a first draft on precise rules for collective ownership. I know it slides into pseudo-legal, but I think it's necessary to build trust that there exist fair solution to potential conflicts.
To make the rule less dry, I add after each section a list of imaginary statements that illustrate the rule. 
# Objectives
This defines the rules of shared ownership of assets. Ownership consist in the following aspects:
- buying assets
- storing assets; eventually paying for it
- maintaining and repairing assets
- deciding when, how and who uses the assets
- selling the assets
```
Example assets:
- A set of tents, with deco and inner furniture for a festival camp
- An expensive sound system
- A car
- A complete exterior cooking set. Burners, gaz cannister, big pots and pans
```
The collective ownership is a kind of non-profit collective organization for lending or rental of objects. It's an extension of the status of private ownership, with adaptable rules of decision making, variable levels of investment where people can go in and out the collective. It's a way to have access to expensive and rarely used material, and an alternative to rental from a private for-profit organization.
It's a way to get cheaper access to some assets, because one don't have to pay for a company's profit, for the complexity of a professional activity, or for the risk taken by a private company, which is replaced by the mutual trust of the members.
# Rules
## The collective
It's a group of people. People can get in and out of the collective. New people can join if the collective approves. One can voluntarily leave the group, or the group can decide to expell someone from the group.
```
Example:
- The collective is composed of 3 members
- One new person joins the collective
- One person lefts the collective
```
## The assets
A group of objects. Objects can be added to the group and removed from it. The assets are considered as a whole. Buying and selling asset is a group decision. Assets also can be received as gifts, offered, trashed.
```
Example:
- The asset group is composed of one tent, one gaz burner, a set of lights, and a table
- The collective buys a set of chairs that adds to the group. It also decides to sell the gaz burner.
```
## Shares
Every member owns a share of the assets. The share represents the proportion of money invested by the member relative to the total value of the assets at the moment of entering the collective. Members can trade shares between each other.
If can be a collective policy to tend to equalize shares between members over time, or to only allow trading toward that goal. One can also let members have unequal shares.
```
Example:
- The asset group value current valuation is 1000€
- Alice owns 60% of the asset group.
- Bob buys 200€ worth of share, from alice. Those share represent 20% of the total value.
```

## Entering the collective
- One enters the collective by buying shares from members.
- Entering the collective needs collective agreement.
```
Example:
- Bob want to be part of the collective; the collective agrees to it.
- Bob enters the collective by buying back 100€ worth of share from Alice. The total value of the asset group is 500€, so Bob now has a 20% share of the group, and Alice share is decreased of the same amount, which puts her share at 40%.
```

## Exiting the collective
- A member exits the collective when they don't own anymore shares. Exiting the collective can be voluntary or forced.
- Excluding someone from the collective, is a obviously collective decision.
- One doesn't need any agreement from the collective to exit. One is then automatically owed they share's value by the collective. There can be a delay in paying this debt, but the collective is morally obliged to pay the debt.
```
Example:
- Caroline leaves the group. She owns 10% of the shares. Two members buy back each 5% of her shares.
- Denis is behaving like an asshole. The collective decides to buy him out. Gives him the money corresponding to his 30%, and not have to deal with him anymore.
- Emily don't want to be part of the collective. She tells everyone she is out, and immediately is own the value of her shares. The collective do the honorable thing and try to be quick to pay that debt.
```
## Expanding assets
- The collective can decide to buy more things. The money is put by members, but it doesn't have to be equally distributed. The share of each member is recalculated proportionally to the money invested, and the new increased value of the assets.
```
Example:
- The collective decides to buy another tent. Adding 500€ to the current 1000€ value. Each of the four members had 1/4 of the shares, for a value of 250€ each, but only two add 250€ each for the tent. The shares are now 1/3 each for them (500€/1000€) and 1/6 for the two others (250€/1500€).
```
## Selling assets
- If the collective decides to sell assets, the money is distributed to the proportion of the shares.
```
Example:
- The collective decited to sell the cooking equipment for a value of 500€
- Bob, who owns 20% of the shares, gets 100€ from the sell. His share of the collective stays the same.
```
## Dissolving the collective
- When the last piece of asset is sold, and all accounts balanced, the collective is dissolved.
```
Example:
- The collective have no use for the assets anymore. Decides to sell everything, and share the money. Last valueation of the assets was 1000€ but it only got sold for 800€. Alice who owns 40% of the shares get 320€ out of it.
```
## Collective decision
Taking a collective decision can be done in many ways. The only rule is that the decision power of one person is proportional to the share owned.
The following are suggestions on how to take decision and describes parameters that can be tuned by each collective. There can be one single way to decide for all kind of decisions, or have different parameters for different kind of decisions, depending of the importance. More important decisions could have higher requirements.
### Synchronous and asynchronous decisions
Decisions can be taken instantly if they take place in a meeting, or done asynchronously via messages. It's a question of balance. Meetings are more complex to organize, but then can make decision making faster. On the other side asynchronous decision making is more convenient, and leave time for reflexion, but slower.
### Proposing a decision
Anyone from the group can propose a decision. It can be during a live meeting or asychronously, via a written communication channel.
```
Example:
- Caroline proposes to buy a new saddle for the collective horse. She writes the proposal in the group chat.
```
### Voting
Members vote for the decision; if the cumulated shares of the voters reach a certain value, the decision is taken. The required approval rate, proportional to shares ownership can be set to 100% of the voters, or less to prevent blocking.
```
Example:
- The collective has decided that a 80% approval rate is required for a decision to pass.
- After votes are cast, cumulated shared of all in favor only reach 60%. The proposal is rejected.
```
### Transferable decision power
One can decide to transfer it's decision power to another member, or only to do so in case of not answering.
```
Example:
Alice is busy and sometimes don't want to get too involved in decisions. She transfers her voting power to Bob in case of not answering.
When a vote deadline arrives, and she has not cast her vote, the vote of Bob now worth for his share (20%) and the one of Alice (30%) combined.
```
### Delay
There is a delay decided in advance for voting on a decision, to prevent stalling. Passed this delay, votes that are not cast are either automatically transfered to someone else if previously declared so, or nullified.
```
Example:
- Denis proposes to get a storage for all the material. He posts a proposal on the collective chat. The collective has a standard of one week for asynchronous proposals to be voted. There are some talks about it, and the members send their votes. One week after, the collective lead count the votes, taking into account vote transfers and missing votes. The proposal reaches more than 80% of the voting shares; it is accepted.
```
### Execution
It's a collective decision to find out who does what needs to be done. A decision is only good if there is someone to execute it. If the thing to do involve significant amount of work, one can imagine a compensation for the member who does it.
## Using the assets


### Asking for usage
Usage of the assets needs to be required to the collective. The collective can decide on automatically allowing the usage under certain conditions. The usage can also be consent based: unless someone opposes, the usage is automatically granted.
```
Example:
- Denis wants to use the cooking set for a giant barbecue in the park for the weekend. He asks the collective in the group chat and everyones agrees.
- Alice's collective don't want to have to allow for usage, so every member is free to use the cooking set. They just need to notify.
- Bob wants to use the tents for a festival a weekend in the middle of july. He posts a message in his consent-based group two weeks before. Nobody has other plans for the tents that weekend aparently, as no objection is raised. So Bob goes forward with the plan.
```
### Lending to others
Just as a privately owned asset, a collective can also be open to lend the asset to people outside of the member circle.
```
Example:
- Friends of Bob want to borrow a big tent for a weekend. Bob asks the collective, everyone is fine with it.
```
### Rent for usage
Depending of the value of the asset, it's tendency to deteriorate with usage, or for balancing the usage between members, one can ask for compensation.
A collective can propose the assets for rent to non-members.
A collective can ask for a usage fee from members to cover for fixed costs, or share those proportionally based on usage.

```
Example:
- The collective is managing an expensive sound system. They collectively own it but require a compensation for it's usage. For a member, they'll ask for 300€ for an event, but for someone who is not a member, 500€ for one event, plus a caution.
- The collective manages a car, that has significant maintenance and tax costs that need to be compensated for. If the usage between member is balanced, one can just pay for the fuel. If some members use the car much more than others, paying a usage fee can compensate for fixed maintenance costs that are shared among all.
- Another car collective could record the time and distance used, and use it to calculate how the fixed costs are spread.
```
### Risk and damages
There should be an agreement beforehand for what happen in case of damages to the assets during usage. Possible choices are:
- The collective takes the risks and will cover damage or loss
- The member that uses takes the risks and will cover damage or loss
- The person that uses has money placed as caution, that is used for covering damage
- A combination of the above
```
Example:
- After a storm in a festival, the tent fabric end up torn. As most of the members were in the festival, the collective eats the repair costs.
- Someone rented the sound system but didn't protected it from rain. The collective order a professional maintenance and inspection. Using the renter caution fully, and covers the rest.
- Bob crashed the collective car, he feels very sorry and pays for a new car with his insurance and own funds.
```
### Maintenance
Maintenance costs like repair, storage, taxes are supported by the collective as a whole. The respective contribution to maintenance is proportional to the share owned, and maybe also the usage.
```
Example:
- Every year, the collective managing the car needs to pay for the car tax. It is spread equally between members.
- In another collective managing a campervan, tax, maintenance and repair are spread unevenly. Tax is spread proportionally to the time used by each member, maintenance and repair to the distance driven by each member.
```
## Revaluating the assets
Assets can't keep the same value forever. Their value should be reviewed regularly. A good indicator is the market value of a similar asset, or a fixed deprecation scheme. When the value change, the relative shares of member is untouched.
```
Example:
- Every year, the value of the tent is decreased of 10% from it's original value. It's value will be 1/3 of the original after 10 years.
- Every year, the value of the car is estimated from the official value tables.
- Caroline has 20% of the sound system. Originally she payed 400€ of the 2000€ purchase price. After 10 years of raving without damage, the value of her shares are only 60€, due to a decrease in value of 10% every year.
```
# In practice
## Keeping records
The core information to be recorded is:
- A list of assets, with their valuation and localization
- A list of members with their respective shares, and contact.
Optional but probably wise to record too:
- An accounting register for settlements
- History of operations. Shares, Income and Expenses.
- Historical of proposals, votes and decisions.
The records must be accesible by all members. It's probably wise to have historical backups, to have one person in charge of maintaining the record at one time. This person, that could be named secretary, is chosen by the collective, and can be replaced, maybe on a regular basis.
```
Example:
- Every year the collective change secretary. This year, Bob volunteers and takes Alice's job.
- The record of members and values are recorded on a plain text file, the record of assets on another. The files are backed up and historical versions are kept. All those document are on an online storage space to which every member has read access.
```

## How to communicate
Everyone is on a group chat. Possibly with different channels for different subjects. A shared document space can also be used for keeping the records.
## Lead
The collective probably needs one lead to orchestrate the operations and decisions. The lead follow the rules of the collective, and only in case of doubt, has authority to take a decision. The lead is chosen by the collective, and can be replaced, maybe on a regular basis.
### Separation of powers
For collectives managing important assets, it's wise to speparate the roles of lead/president, secretary and treasurer.

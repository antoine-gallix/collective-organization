How to take risk with a collectively owed asset?
Same as with private property. Find a balance between:
- lend for free; OR rent
- take risk into the rent or lend; OR ask for guarantee of covering damages

For any aspect of organization, there is a balance between:
- simplicity; AND complexity for features

The proposal is to lay down possibilities. start with the simplest, ask if we want to increase complexity to get more features. Features bring us:
- fairness
- transparency
- flexibility
- control
Have element of comparison:
Private ownership and gift; collective ownership; commercial ownership and rent.

If you can't take risk to trust a collective. You cant take decision in a group you don't deserve democracy.

grow out of relying on:
- people with money to give you stuff for free
- people with time and skill to organize things for everyone
feature of collective ownership allow to invest in quality product, throw away less.
`valuation = start value * annual depreciation`
accept that sometimen not being part of the collective makes sense. If you are far, you don't want to commit, easier to rent.

why being so afraid of organization? all those educated scientists, engineers, managers; handling complexity when they get a salary from a for profit organization. but won't do it for themselves?
I can't hear systim is not working, we need to change, capitalism is bad, community, democracy, solidarity, for the people instead of for profit.

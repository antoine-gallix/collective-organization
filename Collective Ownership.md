# A proposal for camp assets collective ownership

Burns are possible because lots of material assets are brought on site. Some of them are everyday objects, others are very specific to the festival context. Over years of being part of burn events, I've witnessed some of the ways in which those assets are purchased, owned and managed. This is a reflection on purchase and ownership practices in burns, as well as a proposal for an alternative model.

If you already see the amount of writing south of this intro, and think I'm over complicating things, here is my take on this. Yes it might be overcomplicating for the amounts at stake, agreed; I also like to consider burns not only as an advanced culture of party making, but also as an experimenting and training ground for alternative ways of living. If we are able to successfully manage the shared ownership of a tent to use one or two times a year for partying, we might also be able to share the ownership of tools at home, a car maybe? Maybe by getting good at it, and practicing, we get comfortable enough to collectively buy a flat or a house. Maybe even means of production like a workshop, an office, arestaurant, a bar, a club? All this cannot unimaginably be done without precise accounting, fair principles and formalized processes. So why not start experimenting and training with what we are doing right now, and start creating alternatives to our current life reduced to choices between private ownership and for-profit operations.

## What are camp assets?

I use the word asset for any physical object that we use in the camp, that is not a consumable and can be reused from even to event. I use the word asset, knowing that it's used in accounting and business environments would trigger some people; I think it is nevertheless accurate and generic enough to describe all sorts of physical things that are used in burns.

### Examples

For our camp, the following assets are already owned privately by some members and will be used at the burn:
- dome
	- wood beams
	- metal nodes
	- screws, nuts and washers
- kitchen pavillon
- two kitchen burners
- two large paella pans
- gaz bottle
- extinguisher
- waterproof powerstrip
- power cable

# How are assets bought, owned and used?

At the moment, and how assets are usually managed in camps.

## Recycle

We hope to find assets that we need donated through an ad, or abandoned in the street. It works well for things like sofas that people want to get rid of. It can be difficult to do for some specific items. Good luck finding a kitchen pavillon on the street when you need it.
This solution is used when there is no money around, or no will to spend it, no pre-existing assets, and enough available work to find and manage the assets. When it does work.This solves the purchasing problem, but often it does not solve the ownership problem. Because nobody paid for it, it's seen as having no value, and some objects are used once and trashed afterward. Imagine a sofa given for free that gets used for one burn and trashed afterward instead of being used for longer at someoneâ€™s home instead.
Ideally, this is considered as making use of discarded objects, recycling. On the other hand, it can require quite some work to find things for free. And it still doesn't specify who owns it afterward, if it's valuable, or who has to deal with it, if it's just a burden.

### summary

#### pro

- no money involved
- using discarded material

#### con

- can lead to more work instead of money
- dependant on luck to find things
- does not solve the issue of ownership
- can lead to premature trashing of material after use

## Private ownership

One person feels like they personally want to invest in something to use in a burn. The person pays for the whole of it, brings it as a gift at the burn, and manages its storage the rest of the time.
This avoids all group decision problems. It's the form of ownership that we are all used to thinking about. One person pays and owns, and uses as they please. This can be seen as a gift from one person to the camp, as some of those assets don't really have a use outside of festival events. This also relies on one person with the right combination of wealth and desire for gifting, to be willing to spend the money, and have it frozen in an asset that can be hard to resell.
In an idealized viewpoint, one can see it as some kind of self managed form of wealth redistribution; people with more available money, driven by a sense of gift, would spontaneously spend money on something, bring it to the burn for everyone to use, and own it through the rest of the year; all for the pleasure of gifting. Less ideally, one can also see it as unfair, unequal gifting, and conveniently avoiding to think about it.
Usually there is no compensation for bringing one's own. Optionally, it can be imagined that the camp pays some kind of compensation to the asset owner for the use of its material.

### Summary

#### Pro

- Wealth redistribution based on free participation and gifting
- Easy organization. That's the usual way we buy, use and own things in our normal life.

#### Con

- Unfair. Some invest into material, while the value decreases from age, wear; takes risks of damage, low liquidity, for the benefits of everyone. Recognition or even material compensation are optional.
- Limited. There is only so much that can be provided by members for the camp. If it's not enough, the camp can't exist.
- When it works, we end up with camps led by those who provide the material.

## Shared purchase, unclear ownership

Another way that things get purchased is by dedicating a part of the camp budget to buying new things. This introduces the idea of doing something that involves money, as a community. It's an extension of the obvious idea of splitting costs of consumables equally, applied to persisting assets.
It is limited in the following ways. If there is no clear decision made about ownership, the assets are at the end of the event, often in the hands of the camp "core" team, that is the group of friends that started the project. At other events, the fact that this unclear group owns the assets gives them more power to start the camp again. Camp members that are more like guests only for one year, or are not close enough to the core group lose any right on the asset, even though they contributed to its purchase as much as others. This creates a dynamic where an unclear group of people end up accumulating material over the years, from the contribution of many, but under the control of a few; all without the opportunity of establishing fairness. Think at camps that have bought multiple tents over the years, for a value of multiple hundreds or even thousands of euros. Who owns all of this? Why do some of them control the assets and not all that have paid for it over the years?
My interpretation of why this happens is that there is an intent to make assets communal and shared costs, but a lack of followup on ownership principle afterward.

### Summary

####  Pro

- More fairness in who brings the money.
- Feeling of shared ownership during the event.

####  Con

- Unfair inheritance of the assets. They belong to "the camp"; a self declared group of members. The group may not include all that have put money, usually the guest members that don't stay more than one year. It also put a divide between previous members who control the camp assets, and new members that are asked to contribute financially, but might not feel legitimate ownership of the camp assets. Not even talking about what happens in case of disagreement. In case of a split, who ends up owning the assets?

# Why no further option?

I can't respond for sure, but I can imagine a combination of the following factors:
- Avoiding complexity. One person gifting material is easier to manage than sharing the costs, which is in turn easier than when adding shared ownership.
- Reluctance of talking about money and ownership. Getting too complex in managing money maybe feels like "capitalism", somehow.
- Reluctance in requesting compensation for provided material. Even if unequal, it might feel too "capitalist" to ask for compensation.

# A proposal for fair, shared ownership

Now for proposals of fairer alternatives. The goal is to design a system that is more fair and allows a group of people to collaborate in buying and using an asset.A better system of asset ownership should have the following properties:
- Keep track of who has invested money in buying which asset.
- Offer fair compensation for someone lending an asset for the event.
- Keep track of the value of an asset. Things depreciate over time.
- Provide a way to exit the shared ownership of an asset via compensation, and a way to enter in the shared ownership.
- Provide a decision making framework for managing shared assets.

## Shared ownership in detail

### Buying

A group of one or more people decide to share the ownership of an asset. They pool money and buy the thing. Money invested can be shared equally or not. The original value of the asset is recorded, as well as the respective share of each participant.

### Transparency

Information about the object original value, current value, owners and their respective shares should be easily accessible to all.

### Grouping assets

To simplify, assets can be grouped, and managed as a whole. Groups can be merged and split, if all owners agree, to the prorata of the amount invested.

### Exiting the group

It is possible to exit the group and recover the value invested in the asset. The remaining members must buy back the existing member's shares as soon as possible.

### Selling

If the group decides to sell the asset, the money is split to the prorata of the ownership.

### Value reassessment

Assets usually depreciate over time. This should be taken into account and diminish the value of the assets regularly. It's important to have a good estimate of the value of the assets when grouping and splitting, or when members enter or exit the group.

### Decision making

The group needs to make decisions to function, and there should be an agreed way to take decisions. Decision I can see are:
- Buy/Sell assets
- Use of assets
- Merge/Split assets
- Enter/Exit of members
- Rebalance of money inside the group
- Revaluation of the assets
- Dealing with problems
- Changing lead
Decision making is a subject in itself. Some options for establishing a decision making system:
- delegation of decision: one person is trusted to decide
- consensus: everyone must agree
- majority/threshold: a certain number must agree
- consent: unless someone expressly disagree
- delegation of vote: one can delegate its decision power to someone else
- no answer, no vote: people that can't be joined don't decide

### Organizing the group

There should be a person feeling responsible to lead the group. Task are:
- organizing decision making. keep track of decisions
- keeping track of all information, keeping it transparent and available
- be a person of reference for members

# The proposal, applied to our camp

Right now, of all the assets mentioned in the introduction, the dome is co-owned between Baptiste and me, some electric cables have been bought with last yearâ€™s contribution money, and all the rest belong to me (Antoine).
My proposal is to group all those assets into a sort of *camp fund*, as described in my proposal. Value of assets and amount of money invested would be documented. I invite anyone in the camp who wants to enter in the collective ownership of the camp fund to buy a share of it from Baptiste and I. Entering into collective ownership would be optional. You can be part of the camp and not own a share of the assets. And if you do, your contribution will be recorded, and you become part of decision making concerning them. Youâ€™d have the possibility to exit the collective and have your share bought back.
The second part of the proposal is that compensation be paid to the collective as part of the camp expenses.
To summarize:
If you become part of the collective ownership:

- You freeze a bit of money into the camp assets
- You get to decide what to do with it the rest of the time, maybe personally or for other events
- You can exit the collective when you want and get back your share of the value, counting devaluation
- You get a share of the money paid by the camp for compensation

If you donâ€™t want to be part of the collective:

- Part of your camp fee go to pay compensation to the collective.
- Your camp fee only pays for consumables. Food, renting material, cleaning, small hardware.

Overall the system would provide the following benefits:

- Allow the burden of asset ownership that we all depend on to be shared fairly. Your investment wonâ€™t disappear and will be managed transparently and fairly.
- Reduce the camp fee to only what is consumable. Your money wonâ€™t get taxed to buy things you wonâ€™t own.

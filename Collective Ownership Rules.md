This is a first draft on precise rules for collective ownership. I know it slides into pseudo-legal, but I think it's necessary to build trust that there exist fair solution to potential conflicts.
To make the rule less dry, I add after each section a list of imaginary statements that illustrate the rule. 
# Objectives
This defines the rules of shared ownership of assets. Ownership consist in the following aspects:
- buying assets
- storing assets; eventually paying for it
- maintaining and repairing assets
- deciding when, how and who uses the assets
- selling the assets
# Rules
## The collective
It's a group of people. People can get in and out of the collective. New people can join if the collective approves. One can voluntarily leave the group, or the group can decide to expell someone from the group.
```
Example:
- The collective is composed of 3 members
- One new person joins the collective
- One person lefts the collective
```
## The assets
A group of objects. Objects can be added to the group and removed from it. The assets are considered as a whole. Buying and selling asset is a group decision. Assets also can be received as gifts, offered, trashed.
```
Example:
- The asset group is composed of one tent, one gaz burner, a set of lights, and a table
- The collective buys a set of chairs that adds to the group. It also decides to sell the gaz burner.
```
## Shares
Every member owns a share of the assets. The share represents the proportion of money invested by the member relative to the total value of the assets at the moment of entering the collective. Members can trade shares between each other.
If can be a collective policy to tend to equalize shares between members over time, or to only allow trading toward that goal. One can also let members have unequal shares.
```
Example:
- The asset group value current valuation is 1000€
- Alice owns 60% of the asset group.
- Bob buys 200€ worth of share, from alice. Those share represent 20% of the total value.
```

## Entering the collective
- One enters the collective by buying shares from members.
- Entering the collective needs collective agreement.
```
Example:
- Bob want to be part of the collective; the collective agrees to it.
- Bob enters the collective by buying back 100€ worth of share from Alice. The total value of the asset group is 500€, so Bob now has a 20% share of the group, and Alice share is decreased of the same amount, which puts her share at 40%.
```

## Exiting the collective
- A member exits the collective when they don't own anymore shares. Exiting the collective can be voluntary or forced.
- Excluding someone from the collective, is a obviously collective decision.
- One doesn't need any agreement from the collective to exit. One is then automatically owed they share's value by the collective. There can be a delay in paying this debt, but the collective is morally obliged to pay the debt.
```
Example:
- Caroline leaves the group. She owns 10% of the shares. Two members buy back each 5% of her shares.
- Denis is behaving like an asshole. The collective decides to buy him out. Gives him the money corresponding to his 30%, and not have to deal with him anymore.
- Emily don't want to be part of the collective. She tells everyone she is out, and immediately is own the value of her shares. The collective do the honorable thing and try to be quick to pay that debt.
```
## Expanding assets
- The collective can decide to buy more things. The money is put by members, but it doesn't have to be equally distributed. The share of each member is recalculated proportionally to the money invested, and the new increased value of the assets.
```
Example:
- The collective decides to buy another tent. Adding 500€ to the current 1000€ value. Each of the four members had 1/4 of the shares, for a value of 250€ each, but only two add 250€ each for the tent. The shares are now 1/3 each for them (500€/1000€) and 1/6 for the two others (250€/1500€).
```
## Selling assets
- If the collective decides to sell assets, the money is distributed to the proportion of the shares.
```
Example:
- The collective decited to sell the cooking equipment for a value of 500€
- Bob, who owns 20% of the shares, gets 100€ from the sell. His share of the collective stays the same.
```
## Dissolving the collective
- When the last piece of asset is sold, and all accounts balanced, the collective is dissolved.
```
Example:
- The collective have no use for the assets anymore. Decides to sell everything, and share the money. Last valueation of the assets was 1000€ but it only got sold for 800€. Alice who owns 40% of the shares get 320€ out of it.
```
## Collective decision
Taking a collective decision can be done in many ways. The only rule is that the decision power of one person is proportional to the share owned.
The following are suggestions on how to take decision and describes parameters that can be tuned by each collective. There can be one single way to decide for all kind of decisions, or have different parameters for different kind of decisions, depending of the importance. More important decisions could have higher requirements.
### Synchronous and asynchronous decisions
Decisions can be taken instantly if they take place in a meeting, or done asynchronously via messages. It's a question of balance. Meetings are more complex to organize, but then can make decision making faster. On the other side asynchronous decision making is more convenient, and leave time for reflexion, but slower.
### Proposing a decision
Anyone from the group can propose a decision. It can be during a live meeting or asychronously, via a written communication channel.
```
Example:
- Caroline proposes to buy a new saddle for the collective horse. She writes the proposal in the group chat.
```
### Voting
Members vote for the decision; if the cumulated shares of the voters reach a certain value, the decision is taken. The required approval rate, proportional to shares ownership can be set to 100% of the voters, or less to prevent blocking.
```
Example:
- The collective has decided that a 80% approval rate is required for a decision to pass.
- After votes are cast, cumulated shared of all in favor only reach 60%. The proposal is rejected.
```
### Transferable decision power
One can decide to transfer it's decision power to another member, or only to do so in case of not answering.
```
Example:
Alice is busy and sometimes don't want to get too involved in decisions. She transfers her voting power to Bob in case of not answering.
When a vote deadline arrives, and she has not cast her vote, the vote of Bob now worth for his share (20%) and the one of Alice (30%) combined.
```
### Delay
There is a delay decided in advance for voting on a decision, to prevent stalling. Passed this delay, votes that are not cast are either automatically transfered to someone else if previously declared so, or nullified.
```
Example:
- Denis proposes to get a storage for all the material. He posts a proposal on the collective chat. The collective has a standard of one week for asynchronous proposals to be voted. There are some talks about it, and the members send their votes. One week after, the collective lead count the votes, taking into account vote transfers and missing votes. The proposal reaches more than 80% of the voting shares; it is accepted.
```
### Execution
It's a collective decision to find out who does what needs to be done. A decision is only good if there is someone to execute it. If the thing to do involve significant amount of work, one can imagine a compensation for the member who does it.

# In practice
## Keeping records
The core information to be recorded is:
- A list of assets, with their valuation and localization
- A list of members with their respective shares, and contact.
Optional but probably wise to record too:
- An accounting register for settlements
- History of operations. Shares, Income and Expenses.
- Historical of proposals, votes and decisions.

The records must be accesible by all members. It's probably wise to have historical backups, to have one person in charge of maintaining the record at one time. This person is chosen by the collective, and can be replaced, maybe on a regular basis.
## How to communicate
Everyone is on a group chat. Possibly with different channels for different subjects. A shared document space can also be used for keeping the records.
## Lead
The collective probably needs one lead to orchestrate the operations and decisions. The lead follow the rules of the collective, and only in case of doubt, has authority to take a decision. The lead is chosen by the collective, and can be replaced, maybe on a regular basis.
